Summary

Subject to numerous scandals regarding ethical behavior for longer than many people care to remember, clothing retailers face a challenging future. In the age of ‘fast fashion’ some problems - such as the use of fur - many thought had gone have now returned to the mainstream. Unethical behavior issues within the garment industry can be traced back to the relationship between the consumer and the retailer, resulting in problems failing to gain sufficient attention, although some progress has occurred, to inspire change at the top of the clothing industry in the United Kingdom.

Key Highlights

- Real fur has returned to the high-street without the knowledge of consumers. Under pressure to create fast fashion, retailers have failed to maintain the required level of security in the supply chain. Without the current relationship between consumers and retailers, such a turn of events would not have been possible.
- The environmental impact of fast fashion is huge. Manufacturing one ton of cotton requires thousands of cubic meters of water and creates large quantities of waste. Extending the time clothing is used for, even by a few months, dramatically cuts down on the amount of waste and damage each consumer is responsible for.
- Although all companies espouse ethical policies, actions are carefully designed as to avoid damaging the fast fashion business model so many retailers depend upon. Sustainability is, therefore, predicated on the relationship between consumer and retailer. For the industry to become more ethical and sustainable, the business case for change has to be clear.

Scope

- Examines the return of fur to popular stores
- Looks the continuing problem of working conditions
- Assesses the prospect of new ethical shops conjuring popularity
- Details the environmental impact of fast fashion

Reasons to buy

- Why has fur returned to high-street products?
- What is the impact of fast fashion on labor rights?
- What are the environmental consequences of fast fashion?
- Can a new ethical brand enter the mainstream market?]]></summary>

Synopsis

Essential resource for top-line data and analysis covering the Italy retail savings & investments market. Includes market size and segmentation data, textual and graphical analysis of market growth trends, leading companies and macroeconomic information.

Key Highlights

- The retail savings and investments market covers four non-life retail savings and investment products segments: deposits, mutual funds, direct investment in equity, and direct investment in bonds.
- The Italian retail savings & investments market had total investments of $2,322.8bn in 2016, representing a compound annual rate of change (CARC) of -0.3% between 2012 and 2016.
- The deposits segment was the market's most lucrative in 2016, with total investments of $1,266.2bn, equivalent to 54.5% of the market's overall value.
- Banks are struggling to attract depositors as they are unable to offer tempting interest rates because of the ECB's 0% rate. Competitor wars have erupted with banks like Banca Marche offering seemingly unsustainable rates up to 1.9%, but these often require large deposits and the need to tie the money up for long periods.

Key Highlights

- The healthcare providers sector is valued as total expenditure on healthcare in each country. This includes final consumption spending on healthcare goods and services.
- The Greek healthcare providers sector had total revenues of $16.4bn in 2016, representing a compound annual rate of change (CARC) of -4.3% between 2012 and 2016.

- The shrinkage of the Greek sector is a result of ongoing cuts in public expenditure, on the grounds of budget discipline enforced by bailout programmes.

Key Highlights

Summary

Subject to numerous scandals regarding ethical behavior for longer than many people care to remember, clothing retailers face a challenging future. In the age of ‘fast fashion’ some problems - such as the use of fur - many thought had gone have now returned to the mainstream. Unethical behavior issues within the garment industry can be traced back to the relationship between the consumer and the retailer, resulting in problems failing to gain sufficient attention, although some progress has occurred, to inspire change at the top of the clothing industry in the United Kingdom.

Key Highlights

- Real fur has returned to the high-street without the knowledge of consumers. Under pressure to create fast fashion, retailers have failed to maintain the required level of security in the supply chain. Without the current relationship between consumers and retailers, such a turn of events would not have been possible.
- The environmental impact of fast fashion is huge. Manufacturing one ton of cotton requires thousands of cubic meters of water and creates large quantities of waste. Extending the time clothing is used for, even by a few months, dramatically cuts down on the amount of waste and damage each consumer is responsible for.
- Although all companies espouse ethical policies, actions are carefully designed as to avoid damaging the fast fashion business model so many retailers depend upon. Sustainability is, therefore, predicated on the relationship between consumer and retailer. For the industry to become more ethical and sustainable, the business case for change has to be clear.

Scope

- Examines the return of fur to popular stores
- Looks the continuing problem of working conditions
- Assesses the prospect of new ethical shops conjuring popularity
- Details the environmental impact of fast fashion

Reasons to buy

- Why has fur returned to high-street products?
- What is the impact of fast fashion on labor rights?
- What are the environmental consequences of fast fashion?
- Can a new ethical brand enter the mainstream market?]]></summary>

Summary

Retail Savings & Investments in Italy industry profile provides top-line qualitative and quantitative summary information including: market size (value 2012-16, and forecast to 2021). The profile also contains descriptions of the leading players including key financial metrics and analysis of competitive pressures within the market.

Synopsis

Essential resource for top-line data and analysis covering the Italy retail savings & investments market. Includes market size and segmentation data, textual and graphical analysis of market growth trends, leading companies and macroeconomic information.

Key Highlights

- The retail savings and investments market covers four non-life retail savings and investment products segments: deposits, mutual funds, direct investment in equity, and direct investment in bonds.
- The Italian retail savings & investments market had total investments of $2,322.8bn in 2016, representing a compound annual rate of change (CARC) of -0.3% between 2012 and 2016.
- The deposits segment was the market's most lucrative in 2016, with total investments of $1,266.2bn, equivalent to 54.5% of the market's overall value.
- Banks are struggling to attract depositors as they are unable to offer tempting interest rates because of the ECB's 0% rate. Competitor wars have erupted with banks like Banca Marche offering seemingly unsustainable rates up to 1.9%, but these often require large deposits and the need to tie the money up for long periods.

Scope

- Use the Five Forces analysis to determine the competitive intensity and therefore attractiveness of the retail savings & investments market in Italy

- Add weight to presentations and pitches by understanding the future growth prospects of the Italy retail savings & investments market with five year forecasts

Reasons to buy

- The healthcare providers sector is valued as total expenditure on healthcare in each country. This includes final consumption spending on healthcare goods and services.
- The Hong Kong healthcare providers sector had total revenues of $18.7bn in 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2% between 2012 and 2016.

- The Hong Kong government has been recently planning to exempt foreigners from local licence examinations and relax restricting regulation on foreign medical practitioners in order to tackle the severe lack of healthcare staff in the country.

Key Highlights

- The healthcare providers sector is valued as total expenditure on healthcare in each country. This includes final consumption spending on healthcare goods and services.

- The outpatient care segment was the sector's most lucrative in 2016, with total revenues of $17.7bn, equivalent to 30.5% of the sector's overall value. The Long-Term care segment contributed revenues of $14.7bn in 2016, equating to 25.5% of the sector's aggregate value.
- The freedom of choice reform in primary healthcare and elder care of Swedish patients in recent years, has opened up competition.

Summary

Subject to numerous scandals regarding ethical behavior for longer than many people care to remember, clothing retailers face a challenging future. In the age of ‘fast fashion’ some problems - such as the use of fur - many thought had gone have now returned to the mainstream. Unethical behavior issues within the garment industry can be traced back to the relationship between the consumer and the retailer, resulting in problems failing to gain sufficient attention, although some progress has occurred, to inspire change at the top of the clothing industry in the United Kingdom.

Key Highlights

- Real fur has returned to the high-street without the knowledge of consumers. Under pressure to create fast fashion, retailers have failed to maintain the required level of security in the supply chain. Without the current relationship between consumers and retailers, such a turn of events would not have been possible.
- The environmental impact of fast fashion is huge. Manufacturing one ton of cotton requires thousands of cubic meters of water and creates large quantities of waste. Extending the time clothing is used for, even by a few months, dramatically cuts down on the amount of waste and damage each consumer is responsible for.
- Although all companies espouse ethical policies, actions are carefully designed as to avoid damaging the fast fashion business model so many retailers depend upon. Sustainability is, therefore, predicated on the relationship between consumer and retailer. For the industry to become more ethical and sustainable, the business case for change has to be clear.

Scope

- Examines the return of fur to popular stores
- Looks the continuing problem of working conditions
- Assesses the prospect of new ethical shops conjuring popularity
- Details the environmental impact of fast fashion

Reasons to buy

- Why has fur returned to high-street products?
- What is the impact of fast fashion on labor rights?
- What are the environmental consequences of fast fashion?
- Can a new ethical brand enter the mainstream market?]]></summary>

Synopsis

Essential resource for top-line data and analysis covering the Italy retail savings & investments market. Includes market size and segmentation data, textual and graphical analysis of market growth trends, leading companies and macroeconomic information.

Key Highlights

- The retail savings and investments market covers four non-life retail savings and investment products segments: deposits, mutual funds, direct investment in equity, and direct investment in bonds.
- The Italian retail savings & investments market had total investments of $2,322.8bn in 2016, representing a compound annual rate of change (CARC) of -0.3% between 2012 and 2016.
- The deposits segment was the market's most lucrative in 2016, with total investments of $1,266.2bn, equivalent to 54.5% of the market's overall value.
- Banks are struggling to attract depositors as they are unable to offer tempting interest rates because of the ECB's 0% rate. Competitor wars have erupted with banks like Banca Marche offering seemingly unsustainable rates up to 1.9%, but these often require large deposits and the need to tie the money up for long periods.

Summary

Healthcare Providers in Sweden industry profile provides top-line qualitative and quantitative summary information including: market size (value 2012-16, and forecast to 2021). The profile also contains descriptions of the leading players including key financial metrics and analysis of competitive pressures within the market.

Synopsis

Essential resource for top-line data and analysis covering the Sweden healthcare providers market. Includes market size and segmentation data, textual and graphical analysis of market growth trends, leading companies and macroeconomic information.

Key Highlights

- The healthcare providers sector is valued as total expenditure on healthcare in each country. This includes final consumption spending on healthcare goods and services.
- The Swedish healthcare providers sector had total revenues of $57.9bn in 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.3% between 2012 and 2016.
- The outpatient care segment was the sector's most lucrative in 2016, with total revenues of $17.7bn, equivalent to 30.5% of the sector's overall value. The Long-Term care segment contributed revenues of $14.7bn in 2016, equating to 25.5% of the sector's aggregate value.
- The freedom of choice reform in primary healthcare and elder care of Swedish patients in recent years, has opened up competition. In this way, private providers may be favoured as money (insurance reimbursements) will follow patients’ choice.
